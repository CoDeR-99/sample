	<p>	Computer memory is a generic term for all of the different types of data storage technology that a computer may use, including RAM, ROM, and flash memory.	 A computer system is built using a combination of these types of computer memory, and the exact configuration can be optimized to produce the maximum data processing speed or the minimum cost, or some compromise between the two. </p>		</section>	</div>	
<div class="container col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">		<section>		<div id="primary">	Primary Memory	</div>		<p>		Primary memory includes ROM and RAM, and is located close to the CPU on the computer motherboard, enabling the CPU to read data from primary memory very quickly indeed. It is used to store data that the CPU needs imminently so that it does not have to wait for it to be delivered.	</p>		</section>	</div>
	<div class="container col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-sm-12">		<section>		<div id="secondary">	Secondary Memory	</div>		<p>		Secondary memory by contrast, is usually physically located within a separate storage device, such as a hard disk drive or solid state drive (SSD), which is connected to the computer system either directly or over a network. The cost per gigabyte of secondary memory is much lower, but the read and write speeds are significantly slower.</p>		</section>	</div>
