<ul>
<li><b>Artificial intelligence in medical world:</b>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology patterned after the brain’s neural network sand uses multiple layers of information – including algorithms, pattern matching, rules, deep learning and cognitive computing – to learn how to understand data.</p>
<p>AI-enabled tools can identify meaningful relationships in raw data and has the potential to be applied in almost every field of medicine, including drug development, treatment decisions, patient care, and financial and operational decisions.</p>

<p>With AI, healthcare professionals could can tackle complex problems that would be difficult, time-intensive, or inefficient to address alone.AI could be a valuable resource for medical professionals, allowing them to better use their expertise and provide value across the health ecosystem.</p>
<p>With AI technologies, physicians could find information in unstructured medical literature to support care decisions. AI can search and present data to help people find use full health information, which could lead to more informed users.</p>
<p>
AI tools could search structured and unstructured medical records to provide relevant patient histories.AI could identify patterns and help researchers create dynamic patient cohorts for studies and clinical trials.</p>
<p>
Before AI started being applied to medical information in the 2000s, predictive models in healthcare could only consider limited variables in clean and well-organized health data.Today, sophisticated machine-learning tools that use artificial neural networks to learn extremely complex relationships or deep learning technologies have been shown to support —and at times, exceed —human abilities in performing some medical-related tasks.AI systems are designed to tackle the complex data that has been generated from modern clinical care. AI technologies, such as IBM Watson, are being used by healthcare providers, leaders and researchers to leverage millions of medical reports, patient records, clinical trials and medical journals to reveal data insights.</p>
</li><br><br>
<li><b>Clone-World: A visual analytic system for large scale software clones:</b>
<p>Code clones are exactly or nearly similar code fragments in the codebase of a software system . Two code fragments that are similar to each other form a clone-pair. A group of similar code fragments forms a clone class. Code cloning is a common yet controversial software engineering practice which is often employed by the programmers during software development and maintenance for repeating common functionalities.</p>
<p>Due to the unavailability of appropriate tools or interfaces, the programmers are to manually check how each of the candidate clone fragments changed during the past commits, which is extremely time consuming. Evolution analysis of a single clone fragment involves locating each instance of that fragment in each of the previous revisions and analyzing the differences (i.e., changes) between the instances of the consecutive revisions. In such a situation, automatic support for visualizing the co-evolution of multiple clone fragments at a time can help programmers to analyze and manage clones in a time efficient way.</p>
<p>A major strength of Clone-World is its smooth integration of various plots, some of which (e.g., surface plots, and multivariate networks) are common in different visualization contexts, but never been used to analyze software clones. The existing version control systems (such as SVN, GIT, CVS) help us visualize how a particular source code file evolved during the past commits.</p>
<p>The programmer finds a clone detector by searching online and applies it to the codebase to detect clone classes. The back-end (data access and preprocessing) of Clone-World has been implemented using Java and R programming language. The front-end has been implemented using D3, which is a popular JavaScript library for producing dynamic and interactive data visualizations in web browsers. </p>
<p>We have presented Clone-World, a novel visual analytic framework for exploring clones in a software system. Clone-World incorporates big data visualization approach in order to manage code clones in large software systems. It provides an intuitive yet powerful solution to the clone analytic problems. The experts’ reviews on Clone-World reveal possible extensions that could further enhance the capability of Clone-World to help the developers in real-time clone analysis and refactoring. We believe that our work will inspire future research on developing interactive multiple view visualizations for managing code clones and many other software features.</p>

<li><b>Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UWASNs):</b>
<p>Ocean bottom sensor nodes are deemed to enable applications for oceanographic data collection, pollution monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster prevention, assisted navigation and tactical surveillance applications. Multiple Unmanned or Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (UUVs, AUVs), equipped with underwater sensors, will also find application in exploration of natural undersea resources and gathering of scientific data in collaborative monitoring missions. To make these applications viable, there is a need to enable underwater communications among underwater devices.</p>
<p>Wireless underwater acoustic networking is the enabling technology for these applications. UnderWater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UW-ASN) consist of a variable number of sensors and vehicles that are deployed to perform collaborative monitoring tasks over a given area. To achieve this objective, sensors and vehicles self-organize in an autonomous network which can adapt to the characteristics of the ocean environment.</p>
<p>The traditional approach for ocean-bottom or ocean column monitoring is to deploy underwater sensors that record data during the monitoring mission, and then recover the instruments. This approach has the following disadvantages:
<ul type="disc">
<li>Real time monitoring is not possible.</li>
<li>No interaction is possible between onshore control systems and the monitoring instruments.</li>
<li>If failures or misconfigurations occur, it may not be possible to detect them.</li>
<li>The amount of data that can be recorded during the monitoring mission by every sensor is limited.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Therefore, there is a need to deploy underwater networks that will enable real time monitoring of selected ocean areas, remote configuration and interaction with onshore human operators. This can be obtained by connecting underwater instruments by means of wireless links based on acoustic communication.</p>
<p>Although there exist many recently developed network protocols for wireless sensor networks, the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic communication channel, such as limited bandwidth capacity and variable delays, require for very efficient and reliable new data communication protocols.</p>
<p>Major challenges in the design of underwater acoustic networks are:
<ul type="disc">
<li>Battery power is limited.</li>
<li>The available bandwidth is severely limited.</li>
<li>Channel characteristics.</li>
<li>High bit error rates.</li>
<li>Underwater sensor are prone to failure because of fouling, corrosion, etc.</li>
</ul></p>
</li><br><br>
<li><b>Comparative Study for 8 computational intelligence algorithms for human identification:</b>
<p>The biometric system includes the algorithms, procedures, and devices which are utilized for the purpose of recognizing individuals according to their behavioral and physiological features. The approaches of Computational Intelligence (CI) are utilized extensively to establish biometric-based identities as well as overcoming non-idealities usually exist in samples. The study includes 8 top CI algorithms, namely; k-Nearest Neighbor(K-NN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support vector machines (SVMs), Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix (FDM), Naïve Bayes (NB), k-means, Decision Trees (DTs), and Genetic algorithms (GAs). The analyzed algorithms can be selected according to quantity and quality of data presented at work.</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN):
<p>In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method proposed by Thomas Cover used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression. k-Nearest Neighbor based algorithms use for human movements recognition using EMS signals.</p>
</li><br>
<li>Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs):
<p>A neural network is also known as a parallel distributed processing network. It is a computing solution that is loosely modeled to our cortical structures of the brain. It consists of interconnected processing elements called nodes or neurons that work together to produce an output function. ANNs is use for fingerprint identification in computational intelligence for human identification.</p>
</li><br>
<li>Support Vector Machines (SVMs):
<p>The subjects are moving in different angles to the camera plane, on different image scales. This trained SVM is the core of a human detection algorithm which searches optical flow images for human-like motion patterns. Detection of humans in image sequences is an active re- search area within computer vision.</p>
</li><br>
<li>Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix (FDM):
<p>High dimensionality of feature space is a problem in supervised machine learning. Redundant or superfluous features either slow down the training process or dilute the quality of classification. A discernibility matrix (DM) based reduct calculation for dimensionality reduction.Discernibility matrix works only on discrete values. But most real-world datasets are continuous in nature. We use a fuzzified adaptation of discernibility matrix with four variants of dissimilarity measure to deal with continuous data.</p>
</li><br>
<li>Naive Bayes (NB):
<p>Naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features. They are among the simplest Bayesian network models.But they could be coupled with Kernel density estimation and achieve higher accuracy levels. We can predict the probability of multiple classes of target variable. Naive Bayes classifiers mostly used in text classification  have higher success rate as compared to other algorithms. It builds a Recommendation System that uses machine learning and data mining techniques to filter unseen information and predict whether a user would like a given resource or not.</p>
</li><br>
<li>K-means:
<p>A clustering methodology is use  to increase the accuracy rate of face detection by using principal component analysis (PCA) on features extracted from the face candidate clusters. K-means is performed on the original image to segment out potential faces based on the lab color space. K-means is then performed using the grayscale intensity space to segment potential eyes and mouths from the face segments. K-means will be able to effectively segment these facial features for classification. Since there is less irrelevant background information in the eye and mouth segments than in the full face images, PCA will be able to encode the differences in these patterns more effectively.</p>
</li><br>
<li>Decision trees (DT):
<p>Decision tree is a supervised learning method. This method has been used for several tasks in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning as a predictive model. The main goal is to predict the next value given several input variable. MATLAB is used in this study for developing the model. Testing was also coded in MATLAB.</p>
<p>HAM refers to the modelling of the behaviour or activity of the person. Behaviour is regarded as an activity with duration, i.e, the time elapsed from start to end of an activ ity and time of day. Normal and abnormal activity and behaviour can be de texted in a smart house by analysing both, the activity and the time. Abnormal activity detection main purpose is to warn a member of the family or caretaker whether some thing is wrong with the person. This can be regarded as anomaly. Anomaly detection refers to the problem of finding patterns in data that do not conform to expected behavior.</p>
</li><br>
<li>Genetic algorithms:
<p>In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.</p>
<p>To detect human facial regions precisely, without imposing any constraints on the face size, position or features (such as glasses, beard and so on), the method employs a genetic algorithm (GA). First, the proposed method detects the edges in an input image. Second, it searches elliptical regions using a GA, based on the idea that a human face can be approximated by an ellipsoid. Finally, it judges whether each region is a human face or not. We confirmed by computer simulations that the proposed method could detect human facial regions in various images. </p>

</li><br><br>
<li><b>A review of attack graph and attack tree visual syntax in cyber security:</b>
<p>Perceiving and understanding cyber-attacks can be a difficult task, and more effective techniques are needed to aid cyber-attack perception. Attack modelling techniques (AMTs) - such as attack graphs, attack trees and fault trees, are a popular method of mathematically and visually representing the sequence of events that lead to a successful cyber-attack. These methods are useful visual aids that can aid cyber-attack perception.</p>
<p>Attack graphs have been used to model the vulnerabilities of the systems and their potential exploits. The successful exploits leading to the partial/total failure of the systems are subject of keen security interest.
One prominent methodology involves constructing attack graphs of the pertinent system for analysis and response strategies. This not only gives the simplified representation of the system, but also allows prioritizing the security properties whose violations are of greater concern, for both detection and repair.</p>
<p>Most of the computational systems are becoming more complex and engage their respective environments. Since the environments are neither fully controllable nor predictable, this engagement exposes the system behavior into nondeterministic spaces. These systems can be modeled to be in a different state depending on the values of their defining variables at each instant. The execution of the system leading to undesired state with harmful results is referred to as a failure scenario. If the cause of the failure is not a benign internal fault of the system but a malicious action of an attacker, then such a scenario graph is called an attack graph.</p>
<p>Attack trees are conceptual diagrams showing how an asset, or target, might be attacked. In the field of information technology, they have been used to describe threats on computer systems and possible attacks to realize those threats.
An attack tree supports design and required decisions. Attack trees are thus a formalized and structured method for analyzing threats. The possible decomposition of an attack tree to divide the goal into subgoals is an interesting alternative to explore.</p>
<p>Attacks are represented in a tree structure, with the attacker goal as the root node and the different ways of achieving that goal as leaf nodes. The attack tree includes the “AND” node and the “OR” node. To reach an AND node, all subgoals must be achieved. To reach an OR node, at least one of the subgoals must be achieved. The attack tree is a formal and methodical way of describing the security of the system based on varying attacks.</p>
<p>Schneier proposed attack trees to analyze the security of systems and subsystems. It is a catalog of all possible attacks against a system. The purpose of the attack tree is to define and analyze possible attacks on a system in a structured way. The attack trees provide a formal, methodical way of describing the security of systems, based on varying attacks. An attack tree is initiated by a root node describing a type of attack, and each path is terminated by a leaf node (no children). Nodes can be decomposed by “AND” and “OR” relations.</p>
